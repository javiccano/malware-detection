## 1. Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge

    https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification
    
### 1.1 Feature Engineering

    Initial feature engineering consisted of extracting various keyword counts from the ASM files 
    as well as the entropy and file size from the BYTE files of the 10868 malware samples in the training set. 
    Image files of the first 1000 bytes of the ASM and BYTE files were created and combined with 
    keyword and entropy data. This resulted in a set of 2018 features.
    Flow control graphs and call graphs were generated for each ASM sample. A feature set was
    then generated from the graphs, including graph maximum delta, density, diameter and function
    counts etc.
    
### 1.2 Feature Selection

    Statistical analysis of the feature set using chi-squared tests to remove features that are 
    independent of the class labels or have low variance. The BYTE file images were found to be weak
    learners and were removed from the feature set. A comparison of the best features from the chi-squared
    tests with reduced feature sets of between 10% - 50% of the original features.
    
#### 1.2.1 Selection Comparison

    Testing with an ExtraTreesClassifier and 10-fold cross validation produced the following results:
    - Original ASM Keyword Counts (1006 features): logloss = 0.034
    - 10% Best ASM Features with Entropy and Image Features (202 features): logloss = 0.0174
    - 20% Best ASM with Entropy and Image Features (402 features): logloss = 0.0164
    - 30% Best ASM with Entropy and Image Features plus Feature Statistics (623 features): 
      multiclass logloss = 0.0133
      accuracy score = 0.9978

#### 1.2.2 Feature Selection Summary

     The performance of the ExtraTreesClassifier is optimal at around 30% of ASM and image features 
     with highest variance plus sample statistics, entropy and file size. Adding call graph features
     produced a marginal improvement. It is possible that better classification accuracy would be
     achieved by using an ensemble of different classifiers with the ASM, image and call graph
     feature sets as separate inputs to the various classifiers.

### 1.5 Conclusions

   The best accuracy scores were achieved with XGBoost (99.81%) and ExtraTreesClassifier (99.76%) using a 
   feature set of 623 ASM, image and entropy features. Marginal improvements could be achieved using additional
   features and ensemble methods, however due to the limited sample size further efforts are unlikely to produce 
   significant improvements in prediction accuracy. Analysis will now focus on much larger sample sizes from 
   VirusShare.com as described in the following sections.

## 5. Notes on installing xgboost for Python.

### 5.1 Source Install.

 If installing from source, after building and installing you have
 problems loading other packages it is because of the xgboost-0.4-py2.7.egg.pth
 file that the install script dumps in the python dist-packages
 directory. You will have to delete the .pth file then
 go change the installation of the xgboost egg and egg-info files in the 
 python dist-packages directory from:

 /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xgboost-0.4-py2.7.egg/EGG_INFO

 to:

 /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xgboost-0.4-py2.7.dist-info

 and: 

 /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xgboost-0.4-py2.7.egg/xgboost

 to:

 /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xgboost

 Now python will be able to find all the packages.
 
### 5.2 Pip Install. 

 pip install xgboost
 
 Now works for version 0.6a2 on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint distros.
 
 
### 5.3 Anaconda Install.

 XGBoost is not a part of the official distribution but several 
 community members have created Conda packages for it. The
 most up to date package seems to be by user creditx. The following
 command will install the package:

 conda install -c creditx xgboost
 
 
## 6. Notes on Installing Cuckoo Sandbox

  Python 2.7 is preferred for Cuckoo Sandbox, attempting with Python 3.x will be a fail.
  Installing the Python module requirements in requirements.txt results in failure because
  the module dpkt is only compatible with Python 2.x versions. If using Anaconda or python 3.x
  then revert to Python 2.7 or use mkvirtualenv to create a virtual environment to run cuckoo.
  
  For example:
  
  mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python cuckoosandbox
  
  Note: If using Anaconda:
        Remove the Anaconda bin directory from $PATH or it will cause an error when setting
        up the virtual environment. Also ensure that libxml2-dev and libxslt1-dev are 
        installed or there will be build errors when installing the requirements.
     

        
## 7. Notes on Extracting Windows Defender Logs
 
     Open a powershell - (Run as Administrator).

     Enter the following commands:

     > cd \Program Files\Windows Defender

     > .\MpCmdRun -getfiles -scan
     
     Several .log and .cab files will be placed in:
     
     C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Support\
     
     The Windows Defender malware detection log is called MPDetection-yymmdd-hhmm.log


     
## 8. Notes on Multi-Architecture Disassembly with objdump

    Ensure binutils multi-target support has been installed (Linux Mint 18):
    (NOTE: Linux Mint 17 does not have MIPS architecture in binutils, have to install from sauce.)

    apt install binutils binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu binutils-alpha-linux-gnu binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi 
    binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf binutils-arm-none-eabi binutils-avr binutils-dev 
    binutils-doc binutils-gold binutils-h8300-hms binutils-hppa-linux-gnu binutils-hppa64 binutils-hppa64-linux-gnu 
    binutils-m68hc1x binutils-m68k-linux-gnu binutils-mingw-w64 binutils-mingw-w64-i686 binutils-mingw-w64-x86-64

## 9. Notes on Installing LightGBM

    1. Clone, build and install:
    
      git clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM
      cd LightGBM
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..
      make -j
      cd ../python-package/
      python setup.py install
    
    
    2. If you have problems with building or installing python module:
    
      apt update
      apt upgrade
      apt install cmake
      pip install setuptools numpy scipy scikit-learn -U
      

    3. If you have problems with updating setuptools, sklearn etc, and you probably will because (pip == train wreck):
 
      apt purge -y python-pip
      wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
      python ./get-pip.py
      apt install python-pip
      pip install setuptools numpy scipy scikit-learn -U
